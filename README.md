===============

Cryptanalysis against classical cryptography ciphers

The best way to use is to load the modules into an interactive interpreter and then start breaking ciphers
	ipython -i classicalcrypto.py


Requirements
------------
Python 2.7+ or 3.0+

Status
------
Basic encrypt/decrypt functionality for OTP/veneire and caeser including brute force techniques

Todo
----
Normalize input/output for each cipher
Add tests
Add new ciphers, column transposition coming soon
Add frequency analysis tests
